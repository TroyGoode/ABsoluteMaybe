ABsoluteMaybe is modeled closely after [Patrick McKenzie](http://twitter.com/patio11)'s [A/Bingo](http://www.bingocardcreator.com/abingo) library for Ruby on Rails. Some code (namely the z-score/p-value calculation) was ported from A/Bingo to .Net by [Jason Kester](http://twitter.com/#!/jasonkester) for his [FairlyCertain](http://www.fairtutor.com/fairlycertain/) library.
